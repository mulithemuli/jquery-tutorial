# Lesson 5 â€“ reusability / marker class

Comes in handy
- [Preflight / functions and arrow functions](https://github.com/mulithemuli/jquery-tutorial#functions-and-arrow-functions)

Currently every button will be selected. It either does something since the container matches or it does nothing when the container does not contain the correct elements. So we would like to add some marker class to take control if the delegation and action should be added or not.

Covered in this lesson
- marker classes
- event delegation
- jQuery [`.each()`](https://api.jquery.com/each/) function
