# Lesson 5 – enabling the row checkboxes  
  
As for now we have only focused on the innermost checkboxes and amounts. Now we would like to enable or disable the entire inner table when the row checkbox is changed.  
  
When one of the innermost checkboxes is enabled the row checkbox should get checked as well. And when the row checkbox is checked every checkbox inside the row should be checked. If it is disabled everything inside should be disabled.  
  
When the last inner checkbox becomes disabled the row checkbox needs to be disabled as well. Of course the total amount should be calculated here as well.
