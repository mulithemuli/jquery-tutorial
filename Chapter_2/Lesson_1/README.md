# Lesson 1 – creating the table  
  
This lesson has no task. It just shows how we create the table.  
  
We pretend that the server sends the inputs enabled but we want to enable them when the checkbox gets enabled. So the inputs need to be disabled at first.  
  
## Covered in this lesson

- creating the table as the server would provide it  
- applying some Material Design table classes to it
