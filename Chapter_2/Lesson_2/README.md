# Lesson 2 – enabling the inputs  

When the checkbox of the inner table is enabled we want to enable the input field and write the amount of the row to
it. This solution uses the event delegation to add the event listener not to every checkbox but only once to the
table and delegate the event to the changed checkbox.
