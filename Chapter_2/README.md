In this chapter we will create a table which supports some click actions to modify inputs.  
The table itself has one column which contains a table itself. Each of the rows can be enabled for editing by a
checkbox. There are additional checkboxes which allow the selection of all subtable entries in one row and one
checkbox to enable all rows of the table and subtable.
